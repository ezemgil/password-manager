# Password Manager in Java

A secure and user-friendly password manager application developed in Java, designed to store, manage, and retrieve passwords efficiently while ensuring maximum security.

## Requirements

1.  **Secure Storage**: Passwords must be stored securely to prevent unauthorized access.
2.  **Encryption**: Implement encryption techniques to safeguard stored passwords.
3.  **User Interface**: Develop a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the password manager.
4.  **Basic CRUD Operations**: Enable users to create, retrieve, update, and delete passwords.
5.  **Master Password**: Implement a master password system to access the password database.
6.  **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Enhance security by adding two-factor authentication for accessing the password manager.
7.  **Autocompletion**: Implement an autocomplete or similar tool to quickly set passwords in other applications or websites.
8.  **Periodic Password Change**: Encourage or automate periodic password changes for added security.
9. **Password Generator**: Implement a robust password generator that allows users to create strong, customizable passwords. Users should be able to specify the desired length and choose whether to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and special characters.

## Ensuring Security

-   **Salted Hashing**: Use salted hashing techniques to secure the master password. This adds an extra layer of security against dictionary and rainbow table attacks.
-   **Key Management**: Safeguard the encryption key used for encrypting passwords. Consider using key derivation functions (KDFs) like PBKDF2 for key generation.
-   **Secure Input Handling**: Ensure that sensitive user input, such as passwords, is handled securely to prevent exploits like keylogging.
-   **Encryption Algorithms**: Utilize strong encryption algorithms like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) to protect stored passwords.
-   **Security Audits**: Periodically review and audit the application's security measures to ensure they are up to date with the latest standards.
